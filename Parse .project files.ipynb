       "'<h1>Boglioli looks</h1>\\n<p>I really like Boglioli. I think it is a good balance between the Ivy League and British country styles which were somewhat devoid of colour and the too-colourful preppy style. It is also quite austere and minimalistic. I also really like how the models are of a similar skin tone and hair to me, making it easy to imagine how something would look.</p>\\n<p>Here are some pictures:</p>\\n<p><img alt=\"Kind of how I go to work except for the blazer. A darker blazer might work better?\" src=\"https://media.gq.com/photos/57bc9fc27c4c5fcf03df642b/master/w_1600,c_limit/boglioli-gq-style-0916-04.jpg\" /></p>\\n<p><img alt=\"This is a really good look, but not sure about the black, especially the black chukkas. I think dark brown double monks would have worked better in this case.\" src=\"https://media.gq.com/photos/57bc9fc41890ff5802599873/master/w_1600,c_limit/boglioli-gq-style-0916-05.jpg\" /></p>\\n<p><img alt=\"I wonder if these looks work because the models are so handsome. In this case the different shades of brown work really work: dark shade for the bottoms and lighter shades for the shirt and blazer. The shirt is lighter than the blazer, which is quite classical. I think everything was so classical in this outfit that they needed those black pennys to add some gravitas. Brogues would also work here, or something with suede would harmonize beautifully with the blazer.\" src=\"https://media.gq.com/photos/57bc9fc4c4fb86bf3ac6f403/master/w_1600,c_limit/boglioli-gq-style-0916-06.jpg\" /></p>'"
