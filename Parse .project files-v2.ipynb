A darker blazer might work better?\" src=\"https://media.gq.com/photos/57bc9fc27c4c5fcf03df642b/master/w_1600,c_limit/boglioli-gq-style-0916-04.jpg\" /></p>\\n<p><img alt=\"This is a really good look, but not sure about the black, especially the black chukkas.

In this case the different shades of brown work really work: dark shade for the bottoms and lighter shades for the shirt and blazer. The shirt is lighter than the blazer, which is quite classical. I think everything was so classical in this outfit that they needed those black pennys to add some gravitas. Brogues would also work here, or something with suede would harmonize beautifully with the blazer.\" src=\"https://media.gq.com/photos/57bc9fc4c4fb86bf3ac6f403/master/w_1600,c_limit/boglioli-gq-style-0916-06.jpg\" /></p>'"
